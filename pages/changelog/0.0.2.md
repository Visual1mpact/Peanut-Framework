# Version 0.0.2

Compatible with **Minecraft 1.21.50**+

<b><span style='font-size:24px;'>Changelog:</span></b>

## Features

- Added new plugin system.
  Plugins can be loaded by putting a plugin file (`.zip` or .`pfplugin`) into the /project/plugins folder and running `peanut load <path to project directory>`.
- Overhauled compilation, build, and deployment system. All processes are now handled through new gulp tasks; this has resulted in massive improvements, and the ability to use a functioning watch task for development.
- Updated sample '`sample_project`' layout to `0.0.2`.
- Added sample '`sample_plugin`'.

## Improvements

- Previously, all resources were treated as textures. This has since changed; resources folder will now just have its contents copied straight into the resource pack folder. However, you can still use relative paths such as '`/blocks/peanut`' in `TerrainMap` and `ItemMap` entries.

## Bug Fixes

- Fixed incorrect component name for '`minecraft:custom_components`' in Item class.
